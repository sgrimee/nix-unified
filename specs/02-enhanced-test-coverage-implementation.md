# Enhanced Test Coverage and CI Matrix Strategy

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

This specification has been fully implemented with a comprehensive test suite that provides focused testing categories,
eliminates overlaps, and supports efficient development workflows.

## Problem Statement

The original test suite had basic configuration validation but lacked comprehensive coverage for module interactions,
cross-platform compatibility, and real-world usage scenarios. There was significant overlap between test commands,
leading to inefficiency and confusion.

## Current State Analysis

- ✅ **RESOLVED**: 124+ Nix files in test directory with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Individual test categories for focused development
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Eliminated test overlap and redundancy
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Property-based testing for module combinations
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Cross-platform compatibility tests
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Performance regression tests
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: CI matrix strategy with dynamic host discovery

## Implemented Solution

The test suite has been restructured to eliminate redundancy while providing comprehensive coverage. Tests are organized
into focused categories that serve different purposes during development and CI/CD processes.

## Test Strategy Overview

### Test Overlap Elimination (✅ Implemented)

**Problem Solved:**

- **`just test`** previously ran ALL tests, duplicating other commands
- **Platform tests** ran full test suites plus config evaluation
- **Module compatibility testing** was duplicated across multiple categories
- **Host configuration testing** was repeated in performance and platform tests

**Solution Implemented:**

- **`just test`**: Now lightweight (basic validation + flake check only)
- **`just test-comprehensive`**: Full enhanced test suite for CI/releases
- **Individual `test-*`**: Focused testing for development
- **Platform tests**: Simplified to lightweight config evaluation only

## Test Commands (✅ Implemented)

### Core Commands

| Command | Purpose | Speed | Use Case | |---------|---------|-------|----------| | `just test` | Basic validation |
Fast (~30s) | Quick dev checks | | `just test-comprehensive` | Enhanced test categories | Slow (~10m) | CI/releases | |
`just test-verbose` | Core tests + internal tests | Medium (~3m) | Debugging core issues |

### Individual Test Categories

| Command | Purpose | Speed | Use Case | |---------|---------|-------|----------| | `just test-properties` | Module

| | `just test-integration` | Module interactions | Medium (~2m) | Integration work | | `just test-scenarios` |
Real-world testing | Medium (~2m) | End-to-end validation |

### Platform-Specific Commands

| Command | Purpose | Speed | Use Case | |---------|---------|-------|----------| | `just test-linux` | NixOS config
validation | Fast (~1m) | Linux platform checks | | `just test-darwin` | Darwin config validation | Fast (~30s) | macOS

## Detailed Test Implementation

### 1. Property-Based Testing Framework (✅ Implemented)

```nix
# tests/property-tests/module-combinations.nix
{
  testModuleCombinations = pkgs.lib.genAttrs allModules (module1:
    pkgs.lib.genAttrs allModules (module2:
      # Test that module1 + module2 don't conflict
      testModuleCompatibility module1 module2
    )
  );
  
  testPlatformCompatibility = pkgs.lib.genAttrs allModules (module:
    pkgs.lib.genAttrs ["x86_64-linux" "aarch64-darwin"] (system:
      # Test module works on different platforms
      testModuleOnPlatform module system
    )
  );
}
```

**What it tests:**

- Critical module compatibility (nix.nix, system.nix, environment.nix)
- Module importability (syntax errors, missing dependencies)
- Option conflicts detection
- Module validation

**When to use:** When developing or modifying modules

### 2. Cross-Platform Tests (✅ Implemented)

```nix
# tests/property-tests/platform-compatibility.nix
{
  # Test home-manager configs work on both platforms
  testHomeManagerPortability = forAllSystems (system:
    buildHomeManagerConfig {
      inherit system;
      modules = commonHomeModules;
    }
  );
  
  # Test platform-specific modules only load on correct platforms
  testPlatformSpecificModules = {
    darwinOnly = testModuleOnlyOnDarwin darwinModule;
    nixosOnly = testModuleOnlyOnNixOS nixosModule;
  };
}
```

**What it tests:**

- Platform-specific module existence (Darwin vs NixOS)
- Home-manager portability across platforms
- Platform isolation (ensuring modules stay in correct platforms)
- Architecture compatibility (x86_64 vs aarch64)

**When to use:** When working on platform-specific features

### 3. Performance and Resource Tests (✅ Implemented)

```nix
# tests/performance/build-times.nix
{
  # Test build times don't regress
  testBuildPerformance = measureBuildTime {
    configs = allHostConfigs;
    maxBuildTime = "10m";
  };
  
  # Test memory usage during builds
  testMemoryUsage = measureMemoryUsage {
    configs = allHostConfigs;
    maxMemoryMB = 4096;
  };
}
```

**What it tests:**

- Build time limits (configurations build within 10 minutes)
- Module loading performance (modules load within 30 seconds)
- Flake evaluation performance (flake evaluates within 1 minute)
- Memory usage estimation (configurations stay under 4GB)
- Build artifact size limits (configurations stay under 1GB)

**When to use:** Before releases, after performance-related changes

### 4. Integration Tests (✅ Implemented)

```nix
# tests/integration/module-interactions.nix
{
  # Test that conflicting modules are caught
  testConflictDetection = {
    modules = [ conflictingModule1 conflictingModule2 ];
    expectFailure = true;
  };
  
  # Test module dependencies are resolved
  testDependencyResolution = {
    modules = [ dependentModule ];
    requiredModules = [ baseModule ];
  };
}
```

**What it tests:**

- Common module interactions (homebrew+nix, display+hardware, sound+hardware)
- Conflict detection (incompatible module combinations)
- Dependency resolution (module dependencies are satisfied)
- Service interactions (service coexistence and conflicts)
- Package conflict detection (duplicate or conflicting packages)
- Home-manager integration with both platforms

**When to use:** When adding new modules or changing module interactions

### 5. Real-World Scenario Tests (✅ Implemented)

```nix
# tests/scenarios/real-world.nix
{
  # Test development environment setup
  testDevEnvironment = {
    modules = developmentModules;
    verifyTools = ["git" "nix" "direnv"];
    verifyShells = ["zsh" "bash"];
  };
  
  # Test system recovery scenarios
  testSystemRecovery = {
    breakage = "corrupted-config";
    recovery = "previous-generation";
  };
}
```

**What it tests:**

- **Development environment**: Essential dev tools availability
- **System recovery**: System rebuild and rollback capability
- **Multi-user scenarios**: Multiple user support and separation
- **Network scenarios**: Network and wireless configuration
- **Hardware scenarios**: Hardware detection, sound, display, NVIDIA
- **Security scenarios**: Security module functionality

**When to use:** Before releases, after major configuration changes

### 6. Enhanced Test Utilities (✅ Implemented)

```nix
# tests/lib/test-utils.nix
{
  # Helper to test module combinations
  testModuleCompatibility = module1: module2: 
    pkgs.testers.runNixOSTest {
      name = "module-compatibility-${module1.name}-${module2.name}";
      nodes.machine = {
        imports = [ module1 module2 ];
      };
      testScript = ''
        machine.succeed("systemctl status")
        machine.succeed("home-manager generations")
      '';
    };
    
  # Helper to verify no conflicts in package lists
  testPackageConflicts = packages:
    assert (builtins.length (lib.unique packages)) == (builtins.length packages);
    true;
}
```

## CI Matrix Strategy (✅ Implemented)

### Enhanced CI Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml - Updated CI matrix
strategy:
  matrix:
    test-type:
      - unit-tests
      - integration-tests
      - platform-compatibility
      - module-combinations
      - performance-tests
    platform:
      - ubuntu-latest
      - macos-latest
    include:
      - test-type: module-combinations
        modules: ["nixos" "darwin" "home-manager"]
      - test-type: platform-compatibility
        cross-platform: true
```

**Additional CI jobs:**

```yaml
jobs:
  property-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run property-based tests
        run: just test-properties
        
  cross-platform-tests:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Test platform compatibility
        run: just test-platform-compatibility
        
  performance-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Measure build performance
        run: just test-performance
```
