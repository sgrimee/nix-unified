# Nix-Unified Specifications

This directory contains all specifications for features, architecture decisions, and implementation plans for the
nix-unified configuration repository.

## Overview

Each specification follows a consistent format with status tracking, priority levels, and dependency management. The
numbering scheme preserves implementation order and allows for future additions.

## Status Definitions

- **implemented**: Feature has been fully implemented and is active
- **in-progress**: Currently being implemented
- **plan**: Specification ready for implementation but not started

## Priority Levels

- **high**: Critical features that significantly impact functionality
- **medium**: Important features that improve system quality
- **low**: Nice-to-have features for future enhancement

## Categories

- **architecture**: Core system design and organization
- **development**: Developer tools and workflows
- **infrastructure**: Build, performance, and CI/CD
- **security**: Security, secrets management, and access control
- **documentation**: Documentation and knowledge management

## Contributing

When adding new specifications:

1. **Number sequentially**: Continue from 11, 12, etc.
1. **Include metadata header**: Use the consistent YAML frontmatter format
1. **Follow template structure**: Problem statement, solution, implementation details, acceptance criteria
1. **Update this README**: Add entry to appropriate section and update statistics
1. **Consider dependencies**: Note which specifications should be implemented first

## History

This directory was consolidated from the original `PRP/` and `docs/` folders to create a unified specification system
with proper status tracking and dependency management. The consolidation eliminated overlapping documentation and
established clear implementation priorities.

**Original Sources Merged:**

- PRP/01-10 specifications â†’ specs/01-10 with status headers
- docs/hosts.md + docs/migration-guide.md + docs/migration-plan.md â†’ merged into
  01-dynamic-host-discovery-implementation.md
- docs/testing.md â†’ merged into 02-enhanced-test-coverage-implementation.md

This unified approach provides better organization, eliminates duplication, and creates a clear roadmap for future
development.
