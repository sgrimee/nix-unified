# Spec 19: Configuration Cleanup and Refactoring

## Status
üöß In Progress - Phase 1 Complete

## Context
Based on comprehensive analysis of the nix configuration, multiple areas have been identified for improvement in organization, clarity, and maintainability. This spec consolidates all recommendations into actionable steps.

### Key Decisions
- **Auto-categories**: Removing auto-category derivation system (not needed)
- **Capability system**: Required for ALL hosts (no traditional mode)
- **Reporting/graphing**: Removing unused reporting and graph export system

## Goals
1. Reduce abstraction layers and complexity
2. Improve code organization and discoverability
3. Enhance documentation clarity
4. Remove unused/over-engineered features
5. Standardize naming and conventions

## Implementation Steps

3. Phase 3: Remove reporting (removes unused code)
4. Phase 4: Consolidate capability system (reduces complexity)
5. Phase 5: Split module mapping (improves organization)
6. Phase 6: Reduce flake.nix (improves maintainability)
7. Phase 7: Documentation (captures improvements)
8. Phase 8: Final polish and standardization

### Benefits After Completion
- **Reduced complexity**: 4-5 abstraction layers ‚Üí 2-3 layers
- **Better organization**: Related code co-located
- **Clearer purpose**: Each file has single responsibility
- **Easier maintenance**: Smaller files, better documented
- **Faster onboarding**: Clearer structure and documentation
- **Removed unused code**: Auto-categories and reporting removed

## Testing Strategy
- Run `just check` after each phase
- Run `just test` for comprehensive validation
- Build all hosts to verify no breakage
- Review capability debug output for each host

## Rollback Plan
- Each phase should be committed separately
- Git revert available for each phase
- No breaking changes to host configurations until Phase 4.3

## Notes
- Auto-category system was clever but over-engineered for actual usage
- Reporting system was built but never actively used
- Capability system is valuable and should be mandatory for consistency
- User hardcoding should be fixed before adding more hosts
