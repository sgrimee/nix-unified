# Basic Secrets Management Improvements

## Problem Statement

While SOPS is implemented for secrets management, the current system lacks basic organization, access control, and validation. There's no documentation on usage and no systematic approach to managing different types of secrets.

## Current State Analysis

- SOPS is configured and working for basic secret encryption
- All secrets stored in single `sgrimee.yaml` file
- All hosts have access to all secrets
- No secret validation or documentation
- No convenient management commands

## Implemented Solution

Enhanced the existing SOPS setup with basic improvements for better organization and usability without complex categorization systems.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Host-Specific Access Control

Updated `.sops.yaml` to support host-specific secrets:

```
secrets/
├── shared/
│   └── sgrimee.yaml      # Shared secrets (all hosts)
├── nixair/               # nixair-specific secrets
├── cirice/               # cirice-specific secrets
├── dracula/              # dracula-specific secrets
├── legion/               # legion-specific secrets
├── mbp_16_2023/          # mbp_16_2023-specific secrets
└── README.md             # Usage documentation
```

Access rules:
- Host-specific directories: Only that host + admin can decrypt
- Shared directory: All hosts can decrypt  
- Root level: Backward compatibility (all hosts)

### 2. Management Commands

Added justfile commands for common operations:

```makefile
# Edit shared secrets (all hosts)
edit-secrets:
    sops secrets/sgrimee.yaml

# Edit host-specific secrets  
edit-secrets-host HOST:
    sops secrets/HOST/secrets.yaml

# Add new secret to shared file
add-secret:
    sops secrets/sgrimee.yaml

# Validate all secret files
validate-secrets:
    # Checks all .yaml files can be decrypted

# List available secrets  
list-secrets:
    # Shows secrets from all accessible files
```

### 3. Pre-commit Validation

Enhanced pre-commit hook to validate secret files:

```bash
# Check secret files are properly encrypted
for file in secrets/*.yaml; do
    # Verify file contains ENC[ markers (encrypted)
    # Attempt decryption to validate format
    # Reject unencrypted secret files
done
```

Validation checks:
- Files must be properly encrypted with SOPS
- Files must be decryptable with available keys
- Prevents accidental commit of unencrypted secrets

### 4. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- `secrets/README.md` with usage instructions
- Structure overview and access control explanation  
- Best practices for secret organization
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Examples of integration with NixOS/Darwin configurations

Key guidance:
- Use host-specific secrets for sensitive data
- Use shared secrets for multi-host configuration  
- Follow naming patterns like `category/name`
- Never commit unencrypted secrets



## Files Created/Modified

1. `.sops.yaml` - Updated with host-specific access rules
2. `secrets/README.md` - Complete usage documentation  
3. `justfile` - Added secret management commands
4. `hooks/pre-commit` - Enhanced with secret validation

## Available Commands

```bash
# Edit secrets
just secret-edit                     # Shared secrets
just secret-edit-host nixair         # Host-specific secrets

# Validation  
just secret-validate                 # Check all secret files
just secret-list                     # Show available secrets

# Git integration
git commit                          # Pre-commit hook validates secrets
```

## Benefits

- Host-specific access control for sensitive secrets
- Convenient management commands for daily usage
- Pre-commit validation prevents unencrypted secrets
- Clear documentation and best practices
- Backward compatibility with existing setup
- Foundation for future enhancements

## Implementation Steps

1. ✅ Updated `.sops.yaml` with host-specific access rules
2. ✅ Added justfile commands for secret management  
3. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
4. ✅ Enhanced pre-commit hook with secret validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Host-specific secret access is configured
- [x] Management commands work correctly  
- [x] Pre-commit validation prevents unencrypted secrets
- [x] Documentation covers usage and best practices
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

## Future Enhancements

If more sophisticated features are needed later:
- Secret rotation tracking and automation
- Metadata and categorization systems  
- Audit logging for secret access
- Separate repository for critical secrets
