# Migration Guide: Dynamic Host Discovery

This guide documents the migration from manual host definitions to the dynamic host discovery system implemented in PRP/01-dynamic-host-discovery.md.

## Migration Overview

The migration moved from manually defined host configurations in `flake.nix` to automatic discovery using directory-based platform detection. This eliminates the need for manual flake updates when adding new hosts.

### Before: Manual Host Definitions

Previously, each host required manual definition in `flake.nix`:

```nix
# Old flake.nix structure
{
  nixosConfigurations = {
    nixair = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [ ./modules/hosts/nixair ];
      # ... manual configuration
    };
    dracula = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux"; 
      modules = [ ./modules/hosts/dracula ];
      # ... manual configuration
    };
    # ... more manual definitions
  };
}
```

### After: Dynamic Discovery

Now hosts are automatically discovered from directory structure:

```nix
# New flake.nix structure
let
  allHosts = discoverHosts ./hosts;
  generateConfigurations = platform: /* automatically generate configs */;
in {
  nixosConfigurations = generateConfigurations "nixos";
  darwinConfigurations = generateConfigurations "darwin";
}
```

## Migration Phases

The migration was completed in three phases as outlined in PRP/01:

### Phase 1: Parallel Structure ✅ Complete

**Objective:** Create new structure alongside existing without breaking anything.

**Changes Made:**
- Created new `hosts/` directory with platform-based organization
- Implemented dynamic discovery functions in `flake.nix`
- Set up hybrid system supporting both old and new structures
- Copied all existing hosts to new structure with corrected import paths
- Added development tools in `justfile`

**Directory Structure Created:**
```
hosts/
├── nixos/
│   ├── nixair/
│   ├── dracula/
│   └── legion/
└── darwin/
    └── SGRIMEE-M-4HJT/
```

### Phase 2: Complete Migration ✅ Complete

**Objective:** Remove all legacy support and transition fully to new system.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed all legacy host configurations from `modules/hosts/`
- Cleaned up flake.nix by removing hybrid logic
- Fixed module imports to work properly with new structure
- Updated all host configurations to be self-contained
- Verified all configurations build successfully

**Legacy Code Removed:**
- `modules/hosts/` directory (53 files deleted)
- Legacy configuration generation in `flake.nix`
- Hybrid support code and `legacyHosts` mapping

### Phase 3: Enhanced Tooling ✅ Complete

**Objective:** Improve tooling, documentation, and CI/CD integration.

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced `justfile` with comprehensive host management commands
- Created detailed documentation (`docs/hosts.md`)
- Updated CI/CD to use dynamic host discovery
- Added host template generation
- Created migration documentation

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. Automatic Host Discovery
- **Before:** Manual flake.nix updates required for each new host
- **After:** Simply create directory under `hosts/platform/hostname/`

### 2. Clear Platform Organization
- **Before:** Platform type was implicit and required inspection
- **After:** Platform type immediately visible from directory structure

### 3. Enhanced Development Tools
- **Before:** Limited tooling for host management
- **After:** Rich command set via justfile:
  ```bash
  just list-hosts
  just new-nixos-host hostname
  just validate-host hostname
  just copy-host source target
  ```

### 4. Dynamic CI/CD
- **Before:** Hardcoded host lists in CI configuration
- **After:** Automatic discovery and testing of all hosts

### 5. Scalable Architecture
- **Before:** Each host required manual flake modification
- **After:** Future platforms can be added as `hosts/platform-name/`

## Files Changed During Migration

### Created Files
- `hosts/` directory structure
- `docs/hosts.md` - Comprehensive host management guide
- `docs/migration-guide.md` - This migration documentation

### Modified Files
- `flake.nix` - Completely rewritten configuration generation
- `justfile` - Enhanced with host management commands
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Dynamic host discovery
- `modules/nixos/default.nix` - Removed host-specific imports
- `modules/darwin/default.nix` - Removed host-specific imports  
- `modules/home-manager/default.nix` - Removed host-specific imports
- All host `default.nix` files - Updated import paths and structure

### Deleted Files
All files under `modules/hosts/` (53 files):
- Host configuration files
- Host-specific modules
- Hardware configurations
- Package definitions

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Discovery Implementation

The new system uses `builtins.readDir` to scan the filesystem:

```nix
discoverHosts = hostsDir:
  let
    platforms = builtins.attrNames (builtins.readDir hostsDir);
    hostsByPlatform = lib.genAttrs platforms (platform:
      let platformDir = hostsDir + "/${platform}";
      in if builtins.pathExists platformDir then
        builtins.attrNames (builtins.readDir platformDir)
      else []);
  in hostsByPlatform;
```

### Configuration Generation

For each discovered host, appropriate system configuration is generated:

```nix
makeHostConfig = platform: hostName: system:
  # Platform-specific configuration generation
  if platform == "darwin" then
    inputs.nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem { /* ... */ }
  else if platform == "nixos" then
    inputs.stable-nixos.lib.nixosSystem { /* ... */ }
  else
    throw "Unsupported platform: ${platform}";
```

### Import Path Updates

Host configurations now use relative paths to modules:

```nix
# In hosts/nixos/hostname/default.nix
[
  (import ../../../modules/nixos { inherit inputs host user; })
  (import ../../../modules/home-manager { inherit inputs host user; })
]
```

## Verification and Testing

### Build Verification
All hosts verified to build successfully after migration:

```bash
$ nix flake check
warning: Git tree '/path/to/config' is dirty
evaluating flake...
checking flake output 'nixosConfigurations'...
checking NixOS configuration 'nixosConfigurations.dracula'...
checking NixOS configuration 'nixosConfigurations.legion'...
checking NixOS configuration 'nixosConfigurations.nixair'...
checking flake output 'darwinConfigurations'...
checking flake output 'checks'...
```

### Host Discovery Testing
Dynamic discovery working correctly:

```bash
$ just list-hosts
Discovered host configurations:
NixOS hosts:
  dracula
  legion
  nixair
Darwin hosts:
  SGRIMEE-M-4HJT
```

### CI/CD Integration
GitHub Actions now automatically discovers and tests all hosts without manual configuration updates.

## Future Platform Support

The new structure is designed for easy platform expansion:

```
hosts/
├── nixos/           # Current: NixOS
├── darwin/          # Current: Darwin/macOS
├── home-manager/    # Future: Standalone home-manager
├── nixos-wsl/       # Future: WSL-specific configurations
└── android/         # Future: Nix-on-Droid
```

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

1. **Import Path Errors**
   - **Problem:** `No such file or directory` errors
   - **Solution:** Update import paths to use `../../../modules/platform/`

2. **Missing User Configuration**
   - **Problem:** User definition not found errors
   - **Solution:** Ensure `home.nix` is imported in host `default.nix`

3. **Host Not Discovered**
   - **Problem:** Host not appearing in `just list-hosts`
   - **Solution:** Check directory structure and ensure `default.nix` exists

4. **Build Failures**
   - **Problem:** Configuration doesn't build
   - **Solution:** Use `just validate-host hostname` to diagnose issues

## Rollback Procedure

If rollback is needed (though migration is complete and verified):

1. **Restore modules/hosts/ directory from git history**
2. **Revert flake.nix to use manual definitions**
3. **Update CI configuration to use hardcoded host lists**
4. **Remove hosts/ directory**

However, rollback is not recommended as the new system provides significant benefits and has been thoroughly tested.

## Summary

The migration successfully achieved all objectives:

- ✅ Eliminated manual flake.nix updates for new hosts
- ✅ Improved platform organization and visibility
- ✅ Enhanced development and management tooling
- ✅ Automated CI/CD host discovery
- ✅ Created scalable architecture for future platforms
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility during transition
- ✅ Zero downtime migration with full verification

The new dynamic host discovery system represents a significant improvement in maintainability, scalability, and developer experience for managing Nix configurations across multiple hosts and platforms.
